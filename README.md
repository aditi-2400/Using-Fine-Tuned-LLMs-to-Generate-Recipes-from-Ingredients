# Using-Fine-Tuned-LLMs-to-Generate-Recipes-from-Ingredients

As international students we face the daily challenge of deciding what to cook for dinner. The idea for this project stemmed from this very own challenge and the main objective is to output meaningful and practical recipes using the ingredients available. This project fine-tunes the T5 transformer model on recipe data for generating recipes from a list of ingredients. The trained model can be deployed via a Flask web application.
